## The Command Line
1. Navigating and understanding the terminal has always been a "trial and error" for me when it comes to using it. Typing in "echo $SHELL" in my terminal let me discover that I'm not using bash but zsh. I also learned about a simple shortcut, which is using the UP and DOWN arrow keys to traverse my text history, so I don't have to retype a previous text.

## Basic Navigation:
1. pwd stands for Print Working Directory, which tells you where you are in the folders/directory
2. ls stands for list, which will display the the contents of the folder
3. Learning about types of paths, such as Absolute and Relative Paths is helpful when it comes to deciding which to use. Absolute paths specify the location of the file in relation to the root, while relative specifies the location of the file to where you are within the system. Absolute paths can be identified with a forward slash

## More About Files:
1. I learned about how keyword 'file' obtains info about the type of file the requested file/directory is. 'ls -a' displays the contents within a directory, including hidden files
2. I was also reminded that the terminal I'm using is case sensitive and must be aware of what exactly I'm typing

## Manual Pages:
1. Using the keyword "man <command>" (man stands for manual) and "man -k <search term>" allow you to look through commands that you seek to use.
2. Using the manual page will teach you every command available and explains how they works, it's important to stay refreshed on your commands!

## File Manipulation:
1. The terminal has access to all your files and folders within your system and therefore the files and folders in your system can be manipulated in the terminal.
2. mkdir & rmdir can create and delete directories respectively
3. 'touch' makes a blank file
4. cp, mv, rm copies, moves, and removes files respectively
5. You cannot undo actions so be careful when you delete folders/files
